# Forkify Project

Recipe application with custom recipe uploads. 

This was not a project I created by myself but one that I followed along to learn advanced JS concepts.

### Purpose of this project was to learn:
- some of the more advanced vanilla JS features
- how to plan and create a more complex application
- implement MVC architecture
